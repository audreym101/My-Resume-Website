                                <h2>About Me</h2>
                                <p>Hello, I'm Munezero Audrey from Kigali, Rwanda. I'm currently working as a call center agent at Houston Inc, where I assist customers facing complications with coding. This role has allowed me to further develop my communication and problem-solving skills, particularly in technical customer service.

My passion for women empowerment drives me to make a positive impact in my community, especially through education and advocacy for social change. I aim to continue growing professionally, gaining expertise in both customer relations and technology. My career goal is to take on leadership roles that enable me to merge technology with social impact initiatives. Additionally, I am focused on achieving my personal health goals, including reaching my target weight of 63 kg by the end of this month.</p>
